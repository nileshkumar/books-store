              Failed to implement User.book, tried:

              - `Types::UserType#book`, which did not exist
              - `User#book`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:book` or `"book"` on `#<User:0x000000010400eb78>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.id, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#id`, which did not exist
              - `TrueClass#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `true`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.id, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#id`, which did not exist
              - `TrueClass#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `true`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.title, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#title`, which did not exist
              - `Integer#title`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:title` or `"title"` on `0`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.title, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#title`, which did not exist
              - `Book::ActiveRecord_AssociationRelation#title`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:title` or `"title"` on `#<Book::ActiveRecord_AssociationRelation:0x000000012fddd490>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.title, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#title`, which did not exist
              - `User#title`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:title` or `"title"` on `#<User:0x000000012f416f88>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.id, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#id`, which did not exist
              - `TrueClass#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `true`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.id, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#id`, which did not exist
              - `TrueClass#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `true`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.id, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#id`, which did not exist
              - `TrueClass#id`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:id` or `"id"` on `true`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.title, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#title`, which did not exist
              - `User#title`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:title` or `"title"` on `#<User:0x0000000108b01f90>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.

              Failed to implement Book.title, tried:

              - `Types::BookType#title`, which did not exist
              - `Book::ActiveRecord_Relation#title`, which did not exist
              - Looking up hash key `:title` or `"title"` on `#<Book::ActiveRecord_Relation:0x000000010808eab8>`, but it wasn't a Hash

              To implement this field, define one of the methods above (and check for typos), or supply a `fallback_value`.
