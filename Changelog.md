I have covered first two task with tests:

### Task 1: Patients should have the ability to send a message to their doctor through the app.

### Task 2: Doctors have requested the ability to quickly see how many unread messages they have in their inbox. Add a new column to Inbox that reflects this number. Update this number when a message has been sent to the doctor.
